# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Space

Welcome to our open innovation site, where we invite you to explore our work in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to solve complex problems in space, the next domain of potential conflict. We recognize the importance of collaboration within the broader AI community, which is why we've chosen to showcase aspects of our work in a Jupyter Book, making it accessible to both domain experts and computer scientists alike.

Dive into our research, ask questions, make suggestions, challenge assumptions, and correct errors. Join us as we push the boundaries of what's technically possible in this challenging endeavor. Together, we can shape the future of AI for the space enterprise.

#### Remark

Despite 'DRL' in the title, we are not bound to any particular algorithm or technology. DRL, however, is a good point of departure, considering the advances made by DeepMind and OpenAI in using RL algorithms to master games like StarCraft II and Dota II. Our ultimate goal is to deliver the best solution, wherever and whenever it can be found.
