# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Space

Welcome to our open innovation site, where we invite you to explore our groundbreaking work in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the purpose of solving complex war games in space. We understand the importance (necessity) of collaboration within the DRL community, which is why we've chosen to showcase aspects of our work in a Jupyter Book format to bridge communities, making it accessible to both domain experts and software  developers alike. Dive into our research, ask questions, and collaborate with us as we push the boundaries of what's possible in this exciting field. Together, we can shape the future of DRL for the space enterprise.
