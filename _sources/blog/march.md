## DRL for the rest of us

microRTS (μRTS) is a simplified real-time strategy game environment developed by Santiago Ontañón and Costa Huang at Drexel University to experiment with AI techniques for real-time games. It was designed to be deterministic and fully-observable to facilitate research on game-tree search techniques in real-time environments. Their work demonstrated that DRL can be affordable. Agents for full-game RTS were trained on modest hardware (a single CPU+GPU) within 2-4 days, making this research accessible to those with limited computing resources.

Their research presented techniques to scale Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to play full-game μRTS, including ablation studies to demonstrate their importance. Organized competitions around microRTS and the development of Gym-μRTS opened up DRL research to a broader community.

Below is a sample reproduction of their work taken from [**Gym-μRTS: Toward Affordable DRL in RTS**](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/gym-microrts-paper) .
