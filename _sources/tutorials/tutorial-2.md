##  Pilot 2: NNSA MLOps

##### What's the value proposition?
>  *Integrate Machine Learning (ML) into an NNSA work flow (component life assessment, reliability assessment, anomaly detection,  inspection schedules, etc.) to enable predictive analytics and data-driven decisions*

##### What will you be doing?
  - Applying ML methods (decision trees, Bayesian methods, genetic programming) to an existing NNSA process / data sets

##### What are you delivering?
  - ML workflow for chosen case study 

##### How will you measure success?
  - ML discovered insights leading to process improvements

##### What will this cost and how long will it take?
  - TBD

##### What else?
  - TBD
